# Meeting Notes 240404

Participants: Ben Payton, Christian Beren, Ramona Figuera
Note Taker: Ben Payton

## Decisions
- There will no longer be an emphasis on statistical design of experiment.
- Students will still get to design their experiments which involves the expression of the circular DNA.
## Concerns
- The DNA expression kit is very expensive. therefore the linearization of the DNA will likely be cut from the procedure. 
## Deliverables
- Ben will make procedure documents that look similar to the ones on canvas right now. Send them to Christian Beren to be checked.
- Ben will make slides that he can present introducing the concept of experimental design and a little about his research and what being a researcher looks like.
