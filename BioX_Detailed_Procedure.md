4. Centrifuge for 15 min in the AccuSpin at 10,000x g at 4$\degree{}$C. Pour off the supernatant into your pipette tip waste area, leaving behind a pellet of cells. THIS SUPERNATANT NEEDS TO BE BLEACHED BY RAMONA! 
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all of your sample has been centrifuged 
6. Resuspend pelleted bacterial cells in 250 uL Buffer P1 and pipette up and down to mix 
7. Add 250 uL Buffer P2 and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 5 times until the solution becomes clear. Do not allow the lysis reaction to proceed for more than 5 minutes 
8. Add 350 uL Buffer N3 and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 5 times 
9. Centrifuge for 10 minutes in the Accuspin at 17,900x g at 4$\degree{}$C. The cDNA plasmid of interest will be in the supernatant 
10. Add 800 uL supernatant to the QIAprep 2.0 spin column 
11. Centrifuge for 60 s in the Accuspin at 17,900x g at 4$\degree{}$C and discard the flow-through 
12. Add 500 uL Buffer PE to the QIAprep 2.0 spin column 
13. Centrifuge for 60 s in the Accuspin at 17,900x g at 4$\degree{}$C and discard the flow-through 
14. Wash the column by adding 500 uL Buffer PE 
15. Centrifuge for 60 s in the Accuspin at 17,900x g at 4$\degree{}$C and discard the flow-through 
16. Discard the flow-through, open the tube, leave it open for 5 s, then close it 
17. Centrifuge for an additional 2 min in the Accuspin at 17,900x g at 4$\degree{}$C and discard the flow-through 
18. Place the column in a clean, labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. 
19. To elute DNA, add 50 uL Buffer EB (10 mM TrisCl, pH 8.5) to the center of the column and let stand for 1 min 
20. Centrifuge for 60 s in the Accuspin at 17,900x g at 4$\degree{}$C. KEEP THE FLOW-THROUGH, IT IS YOUR SAMPLE (cDNA)! 
21. Nanodrop plasmid (cDNA) to determine the concentration and save one aliquot (250 ng) at -20$\degree{}$C for gel electrophoresis, and another aliquot (500 ng – 1 ug) at -20$\degree{}$C for _in vitro_ translation 
22. Store the remaining sample at 4$\degree{}$C until the next step is ready to be performed.
#### Agarose gel electrophoresis of cDNA plasmids 
##### Materials:

	- Power supply 
	- 60$\degree{}$C water bath 
	- Sharpie + lab tape (blue painter’s tape) 
	- Oven mitts 
	- 100-200 mL flask or beaker with watch glass 
	- 50 mL graduated cylinder (for preparing agarose) 
	- 500 mL container for diluted 1x TAE (orange cap)

	- Agarose 
	- NEB Quick-Load Purple 1 kb dsDNA ladder 
	- 6x Gel Loading Dye (purple) 
	- GelRed Nucleic Acid Stain (1x)
#### Protocol:
1. Measure out 375 mL of 1x TAE (running buffer) 
2. Grab a gel tray with tape already set on the ends and place the comb into the appropriate slot of the gel tray 
3. Prepare the molten agarose 
	1. Use oven mitts when handling the heat flask containing agarose! 
	2. Prepare 50 mL of 1% agarose in 1x TAE (running buffer) using a 100-200 mL flask. Before making your solution, show the TA your agarose mass to ensure proper concentration 
	3. Heat the mixture to boiling while stirring on the hot plate. Swirl the flask vigorously every 20 s to encourage mixing. Wear oven mitts! 
	4. Boil the solution until all of the small transparent agarose particles are dissolved 
	5. Let the solution sit for ~ 10 min (until it cools to 55$\degree{}$C) and then pour the gel into the prepared gel tray 
4. Casting the agarose gel 
	1. Pour 40 mL of molten agarose into the tray to a depth of approximately 0.5 cm. Immediately rinse the flask thoroughly with hot water 
	2. Allow the gel to solidify at room temperature for 20 minutes – you can check it is solid by gently poking the end with a pipette tip 
5. Running the agarose gel 
	1. Carefully remove the comb from the solidified gel 
	2. Remove the tape from the edges of the gel tray 
	3. Place the tray into a leveled DNA electrophoresis chamber so that the sample wells are at the cathode (black) end of the base. DNA samples will migrate to the anode (red). 
	4. Fill the electrophoresis chamber with 1x TAE (running buffer) to about 2 mm above the surface of the gel – make sure the gel is completely covered! 
	5. Mix samples for gel electrophoresis in the following way (keep the total volume below 15 uL if possible): __ uL 6x gel loading dye (purple) __ uL nuclease-free water (used to dilute loading dye to 1x concentration) __ uL sample (linear DNA or cDNA) – add 250-500 ng per lane
	6. Load the gel as follows: Lane 1 – 10 uL NEB dsDNA ladder Lane 2 – cDNA plasmid 1 Lane 3– cDNA plasmid 2 ==modify in the future==
	7. Run your gel at 100 V for 50 min. Do not let the dye front exit the gel 
6. Staining the agarose gel 
	1. Carefully remove the gel tray and the gel from the gel box. Be careful! Nudge the gel into the container provided for staining 
	2. Stain the gel for at least 1.5 hours using 1x GelRed nucleic acid stain (just enough to cover the gel). Leave on the shaker during staining
	3. Obtain a photo of the gel
