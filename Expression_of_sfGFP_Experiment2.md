#### Expression of sfGFP using mRNA, linear DNA and cDNA Experiment 2
##### Materials:
- 70% EtOH (for cleaning tables, gloves, etc.) 
- Dark/amber 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube (autoclaved or RNase-free) 
- RNase-free micropipette tips 
- cDNA from -20$\degree{}$C freezer 
- Murine RNase inhibitor (NEB, stored at -20$\degree{}$C) 
- NEB PurExpress In Vitro Translation Kit 
	- Solution A (yellow, stored at -80$\degree{}$C, Trewyn lab)
	- Solution B (red, stored at -80$\degree{}$C, Trewyn lab)
##### Protocol: 
**The kit recommends 25-1000 ng template cDNA per 25 uL reaction (250 ng recommended)** 
1. Thaw solutions A (yellow) and B (red) from the kit, and thaw the cDNA plasmid. Once thawed, keep on ice. Mix the reactions well, centrifuge briefly and then put back on ice.
2. For a 25 uL reaction (1X), mix on ice in the following order: 
	1. 10 uL 
	2. solution A (yellow) 
	3. 7.5 uL solution B (red) 
	4. 1 uL Murine RNase Inhibitor 
	5. __ uL nuclease-free water (to make total volume 40 uL) __ uL template (cDNA) (volume based on concentration of template)
3. Pipette mix then briefly centrifuge
4. Incubate for 2-4 hours at 37$\degree{}$C (Trewyn lab)
5. Stop the reaction by placing the tubes on ice
